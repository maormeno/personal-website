I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything

of what each of the values mean.

Engineering bachelor's (soon master's) from PUC - Top #1 University in Latam QS -, currently a graduate researcher at the National Institute of Informatics of Japan in Web Privacy Measurements, which composes my master's thesis about Online Behavioral Advertising. I am also working in a Woodtech project near to be launched in Chile.",

My relatives often see me as a driven person with a boiling ambition towards my objectives, facing the path that God has set for me. I believe in restoring a healthy organic relationship between humanity and technology by absorving it consciously and not the other way.\n\nIf you would like to connect or talk about any topic, feel free to reach out to my instagram.',

With a bachelor's (and almost a master's) from PUC ‚Äì the cr√®me de la cr√®me of universities in Latam according to QS ‚Äì I'm currently navigating the intricate world of Web Privacy Measurements in Japan. My master's thesis? A deep dive into the murky waters of Online Behavioral Advertising.

However, although it is still WIP, it is a very exciting initiative which I am very proud of, that assembles different services and technologies in order to provide a solution to the massive timber stealing problem that we currently have in the South of Chile. It involves a React Native mobile app powered by Expo (to emit electronic office guides), a FastAPI backend service (that connects to the national taxes service to genuinely sign the authenticity of those guides), a Firestore database (for offline-first approach), and several Cloud Functions to handle the XMLs, PDFs, communication between the services, and more.",

It consists of a Django REST API that is connected to a PostgreSQL database, and a React frontend that consumes the API. It also includes a script that SERPs (Search Engine Results Page) all the links that result by mixing a set of keywords and making the search in Google (they were 1200), then they are stored in the database untagged, and then they are manually tagged by the user as "yes", "maybe" or " not" answering certain criteria to consider them as useful or not. After this, we built a script that writed an xlsx file with our results and compared them batch by batch, obtaining the Kappa score to measure the agreement between the two people that tagged the links in order to fine-tune our criteria. Once we got to a kappa score of 1 in a batch of 50, we considered the criteria was good enough.',
